      <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Kelsey! I am a lover of all things communication. I can't help but analyze different scenarios,
  conversations, or media outlets for their use of communication tools and techniques. But that's not what an "About Me" page is. </p>

  <p> I am a midwest writer and designer. I have always loved the midwest but I can't help but want to see the world. I travel every opportunity I can. Even if
    it is only a trip to Northern Minnesota!. </p>

    <p> I also am a lover of dogs, (I have a mini goldendoodle myself.) and I suffer through a cat allergy to pet every one I see!</p>

    <p> Head over to my contact page if you'd like to hear more of what I have to say about the world! </p>
